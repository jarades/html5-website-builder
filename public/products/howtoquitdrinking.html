              <p>If you’ve come to my site because you know you have a drinking problem and you know you have to quit drinking because alcohol is harming you and, most likely, those you love.</p>
                          <p>Then do yourself, and your loved ones, a big favor and hear me out because I may have…</p>
                          <h3>The Solution To Your Drinking Problem!</h3>
                          <p>First of all, I&#8217;m not going to give you a load of marketing hype. I&#8217;m not going to tell you this product is the best thing since the invention of football, or that it will make you bigger, better, faster, and richer.</p>
                          <p>But I will tell you this…</p>
                          <p>My home-based stop drinking program, <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em>, can be accessed anytime, anywhere, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
                          <p>What does it do?</p>
                          <p>It takes you by the hand and leads you step-by-step…</p>
                          <h3>Away From the Temptation of Alcohol</h3>
                          <p>My program is not new, and it’s not a quit drinking quick scheme.  <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> has been available for over twenty years.</p>
                          <p>Who has it helped?</p>
                          <p>Thousands of men and women who were desperate to break free of the tyranny of alcohol.</p>
                          <p>The very best thing about this program is that when you use it…</p>
                          <h3>You Will Stop Drinking Alcohol Because You <span class="caps">WANT</span> To Stop!</h3>
                          <p><em>Wanting to stop</em> is the critical difference, and the most important benefit of my program.</p>
                          <p>Using my program, you&#8217;ll quit drinking alcohol because you <span class="caps">WANT</span> to quit drinking, not because you feel you should stop drinking or because of external pressure.</p>

                                <p>&#8220;It was easier than I thought it would be. The first 72 hours were the hardest, but I marked my calendar every day and it became easier. I have lost 14 pounds and feel as healthy as I have since my days in the Navy. Now my friends tell me how well I look. They accept the fact that I am not drinking. Thank you again for your program that gave me the courage to take that first step in one of the finest journeys of my life.&#8221;<br />

                <h3>Imagine How Good It’ll Feel To Say No To Alcohol Without The Slightest Regret!</h3>
                            <p>Take a moment and read the testimonials here. They’re a small sampling of men and women who, over the past twenty years, have used my program and quit drinking.</p>
                            <p>(If you’d like proof or verification of these testimonials, or actually speak to the individuals––and clinics––who have successfully used <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em>, just drop me an email, you’ll find my address at the end of this letter.)</p>
                            <p>My program will change your mind about alcohol the same way it has changed the minds of the many others who are free of the chains of alcohol.</p>
                            <p>It&#8217;s proven to work. Not only has it proven to be successful for individuals (see the testimonials) but leading alcohol and recovery clinics across the country have stocked the program and given it to their patients to help them keep from relapsing.</p>
                            <p>I want to say again what I said earlier because it is the most important thing about <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em>. When you use the program you will…</p>
                            <h3>Quit Drinking Not Because You Have to But Because You Want To</h3>
                            That’s because the information, exercises, inspiration from others, and techniques in the program have a scientific base, and have been meticulously designed to get you to…
                            <h3>Stop <em>Thinking</em> About Drinking</h3>
                            <p>As you use the simple to use exercises and follow the simulations on the <span class="caps">DVD</span> and CD your urge to drink will disappear.</p>
                            <p>Imagine how good that will feel. You won&#8217;t ever again have to say no to a drink because…</p>
                            <h3>You Won’t Be Tempted To Take A Drink!</h3>
                            <p>I named the program <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> because that is exactly what the program teaches you how to do, and what you must do if you want to quit drinking.</p>
                            <p><em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> gets at the heart of what is causing you to continue drinking.</p>
                            <p>Before I tell you more about the power of <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> I have to warn you that this program may not be for you.</p>
                            <p>Why? Because unless you have made up your mind to get over your addiction to alcohol, my program, or any other program will be a waste of time.</p>
                            <p>You have to ask yourself, “Am I truly ready to stop drinking?” If your answer is “YES, I am ready,” then <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> IS for you. And you shouldn’t waste another precious moment. You should start changing your mind about drinking immediately.</p>
                            <p><em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> is a multi-media product:</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li>A 90 minute <span class="caps">DVD</span> with exercises, simulations, inspiration and motivation that works on your mind as you watch and listen.</li>
                            	<li>A 60 minute CD with dramatic simulations that alter the way your brain processes your habitual desire for alcohol.</li>
                            	<li>A 100 page book of powerful mental exercises using state-of-the-art methods from <span class="caps">NLP</span>, cognitive therapy, <span class="caps">EFT</span>, and others, all designed and developed by a brain trust of the leading experts in alcohol abuse, personal development, peak performance, and behavioral change.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Here&#8217;s how to get the most from <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em>…</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><strong>Watch the <span class="caps">DVD</span>.</strong> Not just once, but over and over again because the more you watch the more effective it is.  As you watch and listen powerful visual images, hypnotic language patterns, habit-breaking and habit-inducing sound effects will overpower and replace with positive thoughts and emotions your negative thinking, false beliefs, bad feelings, and the habituated mindset that keeps you locked into life-deflating patterns and shackles you to your continuing drinking problem.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><strong>Listen to the CD.</strong> You can listen to the CD just about anywhere: On the road as your drive to and from work or school. As you jog. Before you go to bed. Anytime, anywhere. The CD&#8217;s dramatic simulations are designed to shift your way of thinking and change your mind and your attitude toward drinking alcohol. As you listen repeatedly you will, after a few weeks, realize you no longer have the urge to drink.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><strong>Read from the Guidebook.</strong> The <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking Guidebook</em> is loaded with mental exercises and dramatic simulations scientifically proven to alter the way you think, act and feel about alcohol.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The exercises are very simple to do. They’re mind exercises. Although simple they work. They are adapted from neuro-linguistic programming (<span class="caps">NLP</span>), emotional freedom technique, (<span class="caps">EFT</span>), the Release Technique, and cognitive therapy. All of which are astonishingly successful methods of altering and changing thoughts and beliefs.</p>
                            <p>A nice thing about the Guidebook is that I made it paperback size so you can easily carry it with you wherever you go––stick it in your pocket or your briefcase, your purse, or in the glove compartment of your vehicle. Take it out during the day and pick one of the exercises to do.</p>
                            <p>Use each of the three elements of <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> <strong><span class="caps">REPEATEDLY</span></strong>. That’s the key. In a short time you will realize that your urge, your desire, your compulsion to drink is gone.</p>
                            <p>You will find you’ve dramatically shifted from someone dependent on alcohol to the new alcohol-free you.</p>
                            <h3>If You Stick With The Program You Will Stop Thinking About Drinking</h3>
                            <p>How terrific is that?</p>
                            <p>Habit-breaking exercises will clear away and obliterate the habits that have led to your drinking, and implant new life-affirming habits.</p>
                            <p>There’s a real good chance that before you know it…</p>
                            <p><strong>You’ll be saying</strong> to yourself and to your loved ones…</p>
                            <h3>&#8220;I Did It. I Changed My Mind About Drinking. I Quit.&#8221;</h3>
                            <p>Let me say this one more time, if you’re ready, <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> is ready for you.</p>
                            <p>And let me say one more thing again…</p>
                            <p>Watch the <span class="caps">DVD</span>, listen to the CD, do the exercises in the Guidebook… over and over again. That’s the key.</p>
                            <p>You see, we change habits and behaviors through repetition. Whether it&#8217;s playing basketball, golf, or any other sport it&#8217;s not talent that makes a good basketball player or golfer. It&#8217;s practice. Shooting baskets over and over again. Hitting balls over and over again.</p>
                            <p>Repeatedly using <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> will build new, positive, life-affirming, addiction free habitual pathways in your brain––new, non-drinking habits replace your old drinking ones.</p>
                            <p>(Most everything we do is habitual. The key is to hold on to your good habits and get rid of the bad ones.)</p>
                            <p><em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> contains images, sounds, music, and exercises and inspiration to re-pattern the way you think, act, and feel about alcohol so that you effortlessly quit drinking and no longer care to drink alcohol.</p>
                            <p>I am so certain that my program will <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> that I am offering you an unprecedented…</p>
                            <h3><span class="caps">LIFETIME</span> <span class="caps">GUARANTEE</span>!</h3>
                            <p>Yes, you read that right, I’m giving you a <span class="caps">LIFETIME</span> <span class="caps">GUARANTEE</span>.</p>
                            <p>Let me spell it out for you…</p>
                            <p>If you don&#8217;t stop drinking alcohol. If you&#8217;re craving for alcohol doesn&#8217;t go away after using this program (obviously you have to use it for it to work)…</p>
                            <p><strong>I will return every cent of your money, including shipping and handling, even if you keep the program for five, ten, even twenty years before returning it.</strong></p>
                            <p>Of course, it goes without saying that <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> will only work for you if you use it.</p>
                            <p>Yeah, it would be great if you could just put it on a shelf and it would miraculously transform you from being dependent on alcohol to someone who doesn&#8217;t need or want to drink.</p>
                            <p>Sorry, but you have to use the program if you want to lose your desire to drink.</p>
                            <p>It will take about four to eight weeks for the program to shift and re-pattern your thoughts, feelings, habits, and behaviors.</p>
                            <p>(Everyone is different, so it may work quicker than that for you. Or it may take a little longer. But once the shift happens the change will be dramatic.)</p>
                            <p>Here is what your life will be like when you are no longer drinking…</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li>No more of the shame that goes with drinking.</li>
                            	<li>No more excuses to your friends and loved ones.</li>

                            	<li>Nofear of getting a <span class="caps">DUI</span>, and the thousands of bucks that would cost.</li>
                            	<li>No more painful morning-afters.</li>
                            	<li>No more living in denial.</li>
                            	<li>No more bad breath.</li>
                            	<li>No more loose you know what.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In fact, after you quit here is what you will experience…</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li>More focus.</li>
                            	<li>More in touch with the lighter side of yourself.</li>
                            	<li>More aware.</li>
                            	<li>Free of all that repressed anger.</li>
                            	<li>New levels of self-confidence.</li>
                            	<li>More true to yourself.</li>
                            	<li>More thoughtful toward your loved ones.</li>
                            	<li>More productive.</li>
                            	<li>So much more pleasure in your life.</li>
                            	<li>More productive at work and at home.</li>
                            	<li>Healthier and happier.</li>
                            	<li>Tons more energy.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>When You Quit You Will Feel Better In Every Way!</h3>
                            <p>As a producer, director, and writer I learned many years ago that there is no greater power to influence and persuade than the power of multi-media.</p>
                            <p>I spent over thirty years studying how the media can be used to alter and change behavior.</p>
                            <p>I took all that I learned and put it into <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em>.</p>
                            <p>I manipulated images and sounds to alter and change your behavior, using the same techniques you see and hear in the hundreds of commercials and advertisements that surround you every single day.</p>
                            <p>But here&#8217;s the big difference…</p>
                            <p>I use those images and sounds to help you overcome and break away from alcohol.</p>
                            <p><em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> works, if you work it. It’s not just me making that claim. Take a look at the testimonials from the nation&#8217;s top rehab clinics…</p>

                            <p><em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> has not only been praised by recovering alcoholics and those with a drinking problem. It has also been acclaimed, and purchased, by leading rehab clinics and Fortune 500 companies across the nation.</p>
                            <p>The clinics give the program to their clients as a graduation gift because they know the power of the program. Those leaving the rehab clinics are told to use the program on a daily basis as a support system.</p>
                            <p>Is <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> for you? It is if…</p>

                            	<li>You have decided it is time to quit drinking alcohol and do something about your addiction.</li>

                            <p>Because we both know, if you do nothing to <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em>, then drinking will not only change your mind, it will seriously mess up your mind and your life!</p>

              <p><em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> is not for you if you’re hesitant. It’s for those who are ready to take action, and, thereby, change their life.</p>
                          <p>It’s for those who want to be free from the problems of alcohol.</p>
                          <p>Honestly, if by now you&#8217;re not convinced <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> is for you, then it’s not for you.</p>
                          <p>However, if you’re ready to <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em>, I’ll make it real easy for you by making it very affordable…</p>
                          <p>What&#8217;s it going to cost?</p>
                          <p>Well, first of all, I am not going to insult your intelligence by offering you bonuses or special enticements or freebies to entice you to order the program.</p>
                          <p>If you’re serious about quitting alcohol, and you&#8217;ve read this far, you don&#8217;t need special offers to motivate you.</p>
                          <p>Remember, I give you a…</p>
                          <p><strong><span class="caps">LIFETIME</span> <span class="caps">GUARANTEE</span></strong></p>
                          <p>Not thirty days. Not sixty days. Not ninety days. A <span class="caps">LIFETIME</span>. Here it is exactly…</p>
                          <p><strong>If, for any reason, <em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> doesn&#8217;t do the job, even if you&#8217;ve had it for years, just send it back and I will give you your money back, including shipping and postage.</strong></p>
                          <p>So you can&#8217;t really lose by ordering the program. (Well, except your desire to drink.)</p>
                          <p>Think about the cost this way…</p>
                          <ul>
                          	<li>How much is it going to cost you if you&#8217;re arrested for drunk driving?  As much as $25,000 after you pay legal fees, court fees, rehab fees.</li>
                          	<li>How much will it cost you to enter a rehab program? Well, the average clinical rehab program is around $25,000 for a twenty-eight day stay. (Of course, you will also lose 28 days of work.)</li>
                          	<li>And what does it cost to buy booze? Have you ever calculated how much you spend on alcohol? Take a moment and calculate the amount you spend each week on alcohol and then multiply that by fifty-two weeks. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re amazed at how many thousands of dollars you spend each year swallowing alcohol.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p><em>Change Your Mind About Drinking</em> cost me tens of thousands of dollars to design, refine, and produce. But the cost to you is a few pennies a day. All three components, the 90 minute <span class="caps">DVD</span>, the 60 minute CD, and the 100 page Guidebook are yours for…</p>
                          <p><strong>Only $179!</strong></p>
                          <p>But you need to <strong><span class="caps">ORDER</span> <span class="caps">NOW</span>!</strong></p>
                          <p>Before you change your mind and your alcoholic mind takes over.</p>
                          <p>Order <strong><span class="caps">NOW</span></strong> and I will ship the program to you immediately. It will arrive in your mailbox in two to three days (in an anonymous package).</p>
                          <p>One last thing…</p>
                          <p>I&#8217;d like to ask a favor. Please contact me after you&#8217;ve used the program. It makes me feel so good to hear from the many, many people who have quit drinking using my program.</p>
